This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.\n(II) The solicitation number is HHS-NIH-NIDA-NIA-CSS-20-006720 and the solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).\nThis solicitation is issued as full and open competition for the brand-name or equal product specified herein.\nThis acquisition is for a commercial item or service and is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13—Simplified Acquisition Procedures; FAR Subpart 13.5—Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items; and FAR Part 12—Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.\n(iii) This solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2020-06, effective June 5, 2020.\n (iv) The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code: 333314—Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing, Size Standard is 500 Employees.  \n(v) Inverted Microscope\n(vi) Background / Purpose / Objective:  The National Institute on Aging has a general requirement for a microscope for daily and ongoing human tissue, animal and cell work of the Diabetes Section, Lipid Peroxidation Unit, and Cellular & Molecular Neurosciences Section.  Currently NIA does not have a microscope attached to camera that we can use to take pictures of H&E stained slides under brightfield for publication purposes. The NIA Sections perform H&E staining on a weekly if not daily basis but do not have a tool to record it with the same regularity. Furthermore, we are requesting that this microscope be equipped with the ability to photograph fluorescence slides – to be able to take basic pictures of islets and brain stained for basic green, blue and red fluorescence. We need this to quantify insulin and glucagon positive areas in pancreatin taken from our different mouse models.  The microscope has the capability to take high  quality pictures more productively and is versatile enough to meet our needs.  The combination of optics for both high resolution brightfield and fluorescence  and the ability to integrate the Zeiss Zen software into our downstream meta data analysis mean this specific system is required for NIA’s research purposes.\nThe intent of this action is to purchase an inverted microscope.

These instruments are the only apparatus currently available to test short access taste preference in mice. The Davis Rig instruments that we are currently using are over 10 years old and have been causing problems in our recent experiments.  Specifically, connections between the rig and the computer are worn and damaged, leading to difficulties in acquiring data. The new system comes complete with a computer for each rig. Three rigs are required in total so that we can collect data from several mice of the same transgenic model at the same age in a timely fashion.  The Davis Rig models that are currently used for short access taste testing in our projects are over 10 years old and have been causing problems in our recent assessment of the taste perception of our insulin knock -out mice. These are the only apparatus currently available to test short access taste preference in mice.  Connections between the rig and the computer are worn and damaged leading to difficulties in acquiring data. The new system comes complete with a computer for each rig. Three rigs are required in total in order to obtain data in a timely fashion on our models so that we can collect data from several mice of the same model at the same age. There have been significant upgrades to the system we are requesting that we require to ensure that the results we are getting are accurate. Specifically, the model that we have currently uses a motorized shutter which can trap the snout of the mouse and thus hurt the mouse. This we understand has adversely affected our data acquisition by introducing a variable we cannot control for i.e. the adverse reaction of the mouse to being hurt by the shutter and thus not wanting to return to lick yet again. The desire for a particular taste in the short access study is quantified by the number of licks that the mouse gives to the bottle with that particular taste and the motorized shutter is adversely affecting their responses. The new system comes with a gravity controlled shutter that does not trap the mouse’s snout and thus does not confound the data with this effect.\nThe intent of this action is to purchase a Lick Access Instrument.   The Lick Access Instrument should be brand-name or equal to the Davis Rig Brief Access Lickometer , manufactures by Med Associates, Inc., P.O. Box 319, St. Albans, VT 05478, Part MED-DAV-160M for Mouse, 16 Bottle, Legacy Version; and COM-106-NV, Intel i5-7400 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Pro 64bit equipment. \nSalient characteristics.  Brief access lickometery studies assess taste preference, chemotransduction pathways, and ingestive behavior in a rapid, efficient manner.  Functional improvements from DiLog Instruments’ design: (1) “Normally up” shutter mechanism (gravity instead of motor driven); and (2) Longer sipper tube to fit new plate design. \nPrior to the 16 bottle setup, the most common taste response setup was the two bottle preference test, where two bottles of fluid are placed in an animal’s cage with one of taste solution (or water) and the other a different taste solution. This test is simple, doesn’t require much in the way of additional equipment, and is relatively straightforward to administer. However, such simplicity comes at the price of interpretive ability. Although taste plays a sizable role in influencing the amount and type of foods/fluids ingested (as in a 2-bottle test), other factors (such as post-ingestive events) can influence behavior.\nThe brief access lickometer is designed to deliver taste samples and measure responses, increasing likelihood that the behavior of the animal is under orosensory control. It can also be used to assess taste preference, ingestive behavior, and chemotransduction pathways in a rapid, efficient manner as there is no dead space in stimulus delivery lines to make fluid volumes consistent across trials, as well as lick tracking without passing electrical current through the animal. It also enables measurement of both unconditioned and conditioned licking behavior to stimuli and/or can be used to train the animal with various stimuli to obtain a reward and/or avoid punishment.\nThe Davis Rig packages contain everything needed for running brief access lickometery studies in a single subject. The eponymous Davis Rig is the only apparatus on the market to test for short access taste preferences in mice.\n(vii) Government's Anticipated Delivery: Within Six (6) to Eight (8) Weeks After Receipt of Order (ARO).

Contracting activity is NSWC-PCD, Code 024, 110 Vernon Ave., Panama City, FL, 32407.\nNature and/or description of the action being approved.\n  This action will award a firm fixed price purchase order to The Sexton Corporation, 2130 Davcor Street SE Salem, OR 97302 for a turn-key underwater camera and recording system for use at the ---------------------------------------------------------------.\nA description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency’s needs (including the estimated value).\n  The contract effort is to acquire the following:\nItem\nQuantity\nA3 Underwater camera and Recording System\n1\nShipping\n1\nThe Government’s minimum needs have been verified by the certifying technical and requirements personnel. This memo does not authorize acquisition for other requirements. This acquisition will be conducted using simplified acquisition procedures with a total dollar value above micro-purchase levels, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold of\n$250,000.00. All items will be delivered within 2 months after award of the order. The contract action will be funded with FY 2020 Service Cost Center (overhead type) funds.\nIdentification of the justification rationale and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractor’s unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service. 10\nU.S.C. 2304(c) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1.\n  NSWC PCD ATF UMS Test Pool has a requirement for a turn-key underwater camera and recording system. The system must be able to work without computer control or software. The Sexton Corporation system has a uniquely capable product that meets all the project\nrequirements and specifications. Project requirements include the following camera specifications: 3840 x 2160 resolution at 30 frames per second; color imagers; synchronization between cameras; 70 degrees field of view; uncompressed video recording and live preview; and automated zoom, iris and focus. This specific camera has a patented technique called “super resolution zoom” that is required for maximum clarity of recordings. The camera also has specific settings to help with underwater visibility. The housing must be capable of continual submersion at 40 feet. The camera system must provide complete coverage of the water column in the center of the--------------. The volume of the water column coverage is approximately 150’ by 230’ by 40’. The output of the camera and recording system must be HDMI format. The Sexton Corporation system is the most cost effective solution as it is a complete turn-key system and includes the underwater housing, the cameras, the recorders, the video mixer and the cabling. No other vendor was identified that could supply the entire turn-key system. Due to upcoming testing at the ---------------, it is most efficient in terms of both cost and time to purchase a\nturn-key system that is plug-n-play versus developing a system in-house through multiple vendors without the assurance the individual components will work together as a system. The Sexton Corporation is the only source that provides the turn-key system meeting the requirements.\nA determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.106-1(b).\n  The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs.\nA description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.\n  For the reasons specified in paragraph 4 above, The Sexton Corporation is the only source that can meet the Government’s needs. This requirement will be synopsized in the government point of entry beta.sam.gov because it is estimated greater than $25,000.00.\nAny other facts supporting the justification.\n  None.\nA statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.\n  As stated in paragraph 4 above, The Sexton Corporation is the only source that can meet this requirement.\nTechnical And Requirements Requesting Official follow this page\nSection C – Specifications\n  Minimum Requirements for Access to Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI):  Prior to access contractor personnel requiring access to DON controlled unclassified information (CUI) or "user level access to DON or DoD networks and information systems system security and network defense systems or to system resources providing visual access and/or ability to input delete or otherwise manipulate sensitive information without controls to identify and deny sensitive information" contractors must have clearance eligibility or submit an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (SF 86) to NSWC PCD Security for processing and subsequent adjudication by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility. \n  Minimum Protection Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information: Security classification guides (OPNAVINST 5513 series) and unclassified limited documents (e.g. FOUO Distribution Statement Controlled) are not authorized for public release and therefore cannot be posted on a publicly accessible webserver or transmitted over the Internet unless appropriately encrypted.\nControlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Controlled unclassified information (CUI) is official information that requires the application of controls and protective measures for a variety of reasons and has not been approved for public release to include technical information proprietary data information requiring protection under the Privacy Act of 1974 and Government-developed privileged information involving the award of contracts.  CUI is a categorical designation that refers to unclassified information that does not meet the standards for National Security Classification under Executive Order 13526 but is (a) pertinent to the national interest of the United States or to the important interests of entities outside the Federal Government and (b) under law or policy requires protection from unauthorized disclosure special handling safeguards or prescribed limits on exchange or dissemination.\n  For Official use Only (FOUO) is a document designation not a classification.  This designation is used by Department of Defense (DoD) and a number of other federal agencies to identify information or material which although unclassified disclosure to the public of the information would reasonably be expected to cause a foreseeable harm to an interest protected by one or more provisions of the FOIA. This includes information that qualifies for protection pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 as amended.  FOUO must be marked controlled and safeguarded in accordance with DoD 5200.01 Vol. 4 DoD Information Security Program: Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) February 24 2012\n  Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems (DoD 8582.01)\nDoD policy:  adequate security be provided for all unclassified DoD information on non-DoD information systems.  Appropriate requirements shall be incorporated into all contracts grants and other legal agreements with non-DoD entities.\nInformation Safeguards are applicable to unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems to the extent provided by the applicable contract grant or other legal agreement with the DoD.\nInformation Safeguards\n  Unclassified DoD information that has not been cleared for public release may be disseminated by the contractor grantee or awardee to the extent required to further the contract grant or agreement objectives provided that the information is disseminated within the scope of assigned  duties and with a clear expectation that confidentiality will be preserved. Examples include:\na.  Non-public information provided to a contractor (e.g. with a request for proposal)\nb.  Information developed during the course of a contract grant or other legal agreement (e.g. draft documents reports or briefings and deliverables)\nc.  Privileged information contained in transactions (e.g. privileged contract information program schedules contract-related event tracking)\nIt is recognized that adequate security will vary depending on the nature and sensitivity of the information on any given non-DoD information system.  However all unclassified DoD information in the possession or control of non-DoD entities on non-DoD information systems shall minimally be safeguarded as follows:\n         a.  Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)\n         b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.\n         c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.\n         d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.\n         e.

Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)\n         g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.\n         h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.\n         i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)\n         j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:\n     (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.\n     (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.\n           (3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.\n         k.

The systems will need to be installed in two separate facilities – a warehouse space and a smaller lab location.\nPSCR is researching the use of virtual and augmented reality for developing, testing, and training on future user interfaces. The lab has developed a variety of virtual environments and scenarios that mimic high risk first responder events using the Unreal Engine. This testbed can be leveraged by developers and researchers for evaluating new technologies for fire fighters, emergency medical services, and law enforcement. A large physical space with tracking will allow for greater immersion of the users by mirroring physical interactions and cognitive load.\nSCOPE\nThe Contractor shall design, deliver, and install a high speed optical camera tracking system for use in a large warehouse environment and a small lab space. The warehouse environment will support a 35’ x 40’ demo area and require tracking around perimeter and cross the center in a grid layout. The lab space will be a smaller scale deployment used for research and development.\nThis system’s software and networking will run on a Dell server and Juniper/Cisco hardware to be provided by PSCR. The Contractor must use the OptiTrack hardware and software as it is the only system identified that supports the Unreal Engine. The Contractor shall install all software and hardware at the FirstNet Authority and PSCR laboratories in Boulder, Colorado.\nThe Contractor must provide additional equipment to support the space including virtual and augmented reality headsets, backpack VR computers, rubber floors for play space, and modular walls for configuring various layouts.\n2.

Point of Contact Lawrence Thomas, Contract Specialist, e-mail address: lawrence.thomas1@va.gov STATEMENT OF WORK General: This statement of work defines the effort required for VA North Texas Healthcare System (VANTHCS), Interventional Cardiology Section of Medicine Service to procure an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) with Pulsed Volume Recording (PVR) system that is a noninvasive vascular test involving a vascular doppler and blood pressure cuffs used to obtain information about arterial blood flow in the upper and lower extremities. This procurement covers essential equipment required to develop a vascular medicine program. The vascular medicine program will be aligned under the Interventional Cardiology service line and will serve as an early intervention/screening program preceding the need for Vascular Surgery intervention. The program will be managed by the Clinical Nurse Manager, Cardiology under the direction of the Section Chief, Cardiology. The intended place of performance includes multiple sites within the VANTHCS including the Dallas, Bonham, Plano, and Fort Worth campuses. This acquisition will require a single occurrence delivery schedule of equipment with a fixed-rate purchase agreement. The equipment will be delivered to the VANTHCS warehouse, assigned an equipment inventory number through the logistics department, and undergo an electrical-biomedical safety inspection by the Bio-med service at VANTHCS-Dallas campus prior to delivery to the service. The service will inspect the purchase/inventory statement against delivered items and accept the equipment for use upon receipt. Description of Work: The ABI/PVR system will be used to assess the peripheral vascular status in patients screened as "high risk" seen in the Vascular Medicine program. The primary purpose of the ABI/PVR is to identify the anatomy and malfunctioning vessels (arteries and veins) and assess the extent of insufficiency present. ABI is the cornerstone of PAD/PVD evaluation. The equipment involves the use of four blood pressure cuffs place strategically on each upper and lower extremity (see fig 1 below). A measurement is recorded from each cuff. The measurements are compared against standard parameters to diagnose the presence of PVD/PAD and determine significance. A dual ABI/PVR system provides a complete, thorough workup and eliminates the inherent limitations of stand-alone ABI. On-site Equipment and training: Contractor will provide on-site training regarding standard operating procedures of the System. Training will include a demonstration of how to use all the listed features of the System as well as any applicable User configuration including installation support. Requested delivery date is 30 days from award. Manufacturer: Unetixs Model: Roodra, Unetixs Multilab Series III Location: 5B668, Dallas VA Medical Center at 4500 S. Lancaster Rd.

Original equipment manufacturer part number: MULTILAB SERIES III ROODRA VASCULAR SYSTEM with DICOM SR k. Other pertinent information that describes the item, material or service required: The equipment must provide Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), pulse volume recording, doppler waveforms, and toe pressures. The Interventional Cardiology Section requires an ABI/PVR system to perform early assessment/identification of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PAD/PVD affects more than eight million Americans. Despite significant associated morbidity and mortality less than 3% of the screening recommended population undergo early assessment or intervention. The Society for Vascular Medicine recommends screening for the following patients at risk for PAD/PVD: By Specific Age At Any Age <50 years old with Diabetes or other atherosclerotic risk factor Exertional leg symptoms or resting ischemic pain 50-69 years old with history of smoking or diabetes Abnormal pulse in the lower extremity >70 years old with or without risk factors Atherosclerotic disease: coronary, carotid or renal Adaptedfrom Hirsch AT et al. Available at www.acc.org/clinical/guidelines/pad/summary.pdf 45.2% of the veteran population served at VANTHCS are between the ages of 4564 with a mean age of 58 years old, more than 28% of the veterans served at VANTHCS have diabetes, and 62% of the total veterans enrolled for care at the Dallas VA Medial Center. VANTHCS report smoking or prior tobacco abuse. Approximately 45% or greater of the total veterans served at VANTHCS fall into one or more of the recommended PAD/PVD screening groups. We currently cannot provide this needed clinical service secondary to lack of an existing Vascular Medicine program and lack of required equipment. It is intended to develop, structure, and implement a comprehensive Vascular Medicine program using standardized clinical screening and intervention guidelines to address the disparities that currently exists.

A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor\'s rights to use data as described in Rights in Data- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. GENERAL RULES OF BEHAVIOR a. Rules of Behavior are part of a comprehensive program to provide complete information security. These rules establish standards of behavior in recognition of the fact that knowledgeable users are the foundation of a successful security program.

(6) Contractors use of systems, information, or sites is strictly limited to fulfill the terms of the contract. I understand no personal use is authorized. I will only use other Federal government information systems as expressly authorized by the terms of those systems. I accept that the restrictions under ethics regulations and criminal law still apply. (7) Grant access to systems and information only to those who have an official need to know. (8) Protect passwords from access by other individuals. (9) Create and change passwords in accordance with VA Handbook 6500 on systems and any devices protecting VA information as well as the rules of behavior and security settings for the particular system in question. (10) Protect information and systems from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification, or destruction. I will only use encryption that is FIPS 140-2 validated to safeguard VA sensitive information, both safeguarding VA sensitive information in storage and in transit regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA. (11) Follow VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization to protect VA information. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR\'s orders. (12) Ensure that the COTR has previously approved VA information for public dissemination, including e-mail communications outside of the VA as appropriate. I will not make any unauthorized disclosure of any VA sensitive information through the use of any means of communication including but not limited to e-mail, instant messaging, online chat, and web bulletin boards or logs. (13) Not host, set up, administer, or run an Internet server related to my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with the VA unless explicitly authorized under the contract or in writing by the COTR. (14) Protect government property from theft, destruction, or misuse. I will follow VA directives and handbooks on handling Federal government IT equipment, information, and systems. I will not take VA sensitive information from the workplace without authorization from the COTR. (15) Only use anti-virus software, antispyware, and firewall/intrusion detection software authorized by VA. I will contact the COTR for policies and guidance on complying with this requirement and will follow the COTR\'s orders regarding my access to and use of any information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. (16) Not disable or degrade the standard anti-virus software, antispyware, and/or firewall/intrusion detection software on the computer I use to access and use information assets or resources associated with my performance of services under the contract terms with VA. I will report anti-virus, antispyware, firewall or intrusion detection software errors, or significant alert messages to the COTR. (17) Understand that restoration of service of any VA system is a concern of all users of the system. (18) Complete required information security and privacy training, and complete required training for the particular systems to which I require access.

A major source for the synchrotron X-rays in the US will be unavailable in the near future due to a major multi-year upgrade at The Advanced Photon Source.  These upgrades mean that  there is going be a significantly increased need for X-rays at the NIH for crystallographic data collection. This need can be met by taking full advantage of recent developments in laboratory based X-ray source technology and X-ray detector technology.\nThe project is aimed at providing the best possible quality Macromolecular X-ray Crsytallography (MX) data collection capabilities to support the mission of the NIDDK to understand how critical biological acromolecules work through the elucidation of their molecular structure. The need is clear as there will be several years when MX capabilities in the US will be significantly decreased due the upgrade process of the Advanced Photon Source where NIDDK researchers currently collect MX data. The\ncombination of an FR-X high flux X-ray generator, the VariMax VHF confocal X-ray optics and the EigerR 4M hybrid photon counting (HPC) detector manufactured by Rigaku Americas together will create an MX platform approaching the capabilities of a synchrotron bending magnet beamline. The combination of these instruments provides the best possible laboratory based MX capabilities available as it allows development.\n3.0    OBJECTIVE\nThe main objective of this acquisition is to provide the NIDDK and NIH structural biology groups with an X-ray crystallographic resource that can provide better diffraction data quality than the existing resources, and can approach the data quality that can be measured at synchrotron bending magnet beamline.  In addition, this purchase will provide the NIDDK X-ray diffraction laboratory with two Eiger 4M hybrid photon counting detectors on the two available ports of a new high flux density rotating anode generator.  Furthermore, the laboratory will also have a BioSAX-1000 small angle scattering system re-installed on an existing MicroMax-007 HF X-ray generators.\nPlease note that the NIDDK wishes to trade in the following equipment to Rigaku Americas Corporation which will no longer fit the NIDDK’s needs:\n•    MicroMax-007HF (SN: DD307408), will be reclaimed by Rigaku for trade-in (includes packing and removal)\n•    Saturn A200 (SN: 09380200), will be reclaimed by Rigaku for trade-in (includes packing and removal)\n4.0     SALIENT / REQUIRED FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS\nTotal system price includes both delivery and inside delivery, assembly, installation, 12 months on-site labor and parts warranty (excluding consumables), and on-site basic operation/maintenance training. \n•    Contractor will ship and install a rotating anode X-ray generator that is dual port and generates X-ray radiation using a Cu target.\n•    The source of the X-ray source on the surface of the target will not be larger than 70 microns approximately in effective size taking the option take off angle into consideration.\n•    The maximum loading on this source has to be at least 2.97 kW.\n•    The contractor will ship and install a confocal optical system that will focus X-rays from the X-ray source to a 100 micron pinhole of the collimator that will be supplied by the contractor.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation, 75N91020Q00066, is issued as a request for quote (RFQ) and includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) FAC 2020-06 (06-05-2020) simplified acquisition procedures for commercial items.\nThe North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1,000 employees. \n1.0 BRAND NAME OR EQUAL\nThis requirement is for the procurement of the brand name or equivalent instruments described in section 4.0. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provision FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999) is applicable to this requirement.\n2.0 BACKGROUND\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Molecular Imaging Program (MIP) requires the purchase of one (1) Becton Dickinson FACSLyric flow cytometer, or equivalent. The required instrument will replace an existing Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer. A flow cytometer is an essential piece of equipment for the pre-clinical group in the MIP and is used to analyze optical probes and cell receptors.\n3.0 TYPE OF ORDER\nThis is a Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order.\n4.0 PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS\nThe instrument shall:\nInclude a monitor for end users to view several gating results at a time and a separate desktop computer for end users to set up studies, analyze data and copy to flash drive if needed. \nInclude polystyrene beads dyed with fluorochromes that allows the software to characterize, track, and report performance measurements for the flow cytometer. Beads shall consist of equal quantities of bright, mid, and dim beads in phosphate buffered saline with sodium azide.\nPerform automated single tube QC (quality control) with dyed polystyrene beads instead of requiring manual QC using single color beads.\nInclude bead dilution buffer, cleaning agent for daily use, and fluid for running the instrument\nInclude at no charge fluorescent beads containing the following dyes:  FITC, PE, APC, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC-Cy7, PerCP, and dyes with absorptions of 415nm and 404nm and emission peaks of 500nm and 448nm, respectively. The beads need only to be run every 60 days and enable the software to determine spillover values (SOVs) for fluorescence compensation and calculate a fluorescence compensation matrix during setup of flow cytometer.\nHave a minimum of 3 lasers (red, blue and violet) and be capable of detecting a minimum of 8 dyes. The 8 dyes shall include followings; FITC, PE, PCP-Cy5.5 and PE-Cy7 from blue laser, APC or Alexa Fluor 647, APC-Cy7 from red laser, and dyes capable of being detected with a violet laser with maximum absorptions between 404-407nm and 405-415nm and emission peaks between 421-448nm and 500-510nm, respectively. \nHave the ability to be upgraded on-site by the manufacturer to detect an additional 4 dyes for a total of 12 dyes. The additional dyes shall include Alexa Fluor 700, and dyes optimized and excited by a violet laser with the following absorption and emission wavelengths: 405nm, 407nm, 407nm and 600-602nm, 702-711nm, 780-786nm, respectively.  This increases the instrument’s flexibility.\nOffer a manual sample acquisition capable of accepting 12 x 75-mm tubes and microcentrifuge tubes. Manual acquisition is useful if you only have a few samples or samples that aren’t in 96 well plates.\nProvide software with the ability to automate the process of compensating the spectral overlap of fluorochromes used in the lab. The software shall allow the user to export the user-defined assays in given format so that users can reproduce assays at different times.\nCapable of collecting events (data from cells) at very high speed (minimum of 25,000 events per second). This allows several events to be collected rapidly and a sufficient number of cells for statistically significant detection.\nBe capable of acquiring unlimited events per sample so the users can collect data from rare cell populations effectively.\nInclude a system that offers superior sensitivity to detect low intensity signal effectively such as gel coupled flow cell or equivalent.\nBe capable of a High Sensitivity Mode (flow rate 50uL/min) in order to accommodate samples that contain rare populations. This mode allows the cells to travel through the laser beam at half the usual sheath velocity and allows for a two-fold increase in sensitivity.\nUse the heptagon fluorescence collection system or equivalent which minimizes the number of times fluorescence signals shall pass through dichroic mirrors, maximizing signal intensity and eliminating alignment of fluorescence channels.\nInclude electronic IDs (chip coded) or equivalent for each filter-mirror combination, ensuring that the configuration is as expected for a given experiment. In case of mismatch the user can identify that before collecting data, ensuring accurate results.            \nBe capable of setting multiple parameter threshold.  The ability to threshold on more than one parameter is a very powerful tool when working with small particles or sample preps with large amounts of unwanted particles.\nInclude a universal sample loader capable of using 12x75mm tube racks as well as a 96 well plate. The ability to set up multiple 12x75mm sample tubes or a 96 well plate and walk away saves the user time from standing at the instrument.  The end user requires the ability to set up multiple 12x75mm tubes in order to collect rare cells from tumor samples from large volumes. Per the lab’s sample preparation protocol, samples are strained through a filter attached to 12x75mm tubes. The same tube is used in the instrument to save time and money. To maintain consistency and prevent loss of sample, a loader capable of using a 12x75mm tube rack is required. One sample loader capable of accommodating both types of sample sizes saves space and time of switching out loader each time running samples.\nInclude automated on board vortexing of tubes and plates for mixing and resuspension of cells. The automated vortexing prevents the cells from settling at the bottom of the tube.  Strength and duration of vortexing can be determined by the end user in the software program.\nInclude 30 and 40 tube (12x75mm) racks for sample loader. The racks are required to run the samples in 12x75mm tubes for the sample loader and will allow the user to walk away and perform other studies. When analyzing primary tissue samples, the lab’s sample preparation protocol requires the use of a filter (strainer) that is attached to a 12x75mm tube.  The same tube is used to analyze the sample in the instrument which saves time and money. \nContain a loader that is equipped with barcode scanner that can match rack barcode and tube barcodes to what is expected per the software program and provide error management capabilities in case of mismatch. This allows the user to walk away after the start of the multi-tube or plate run.\nBe capable of programming an automated start up and auto shutdown and power off to increase productivity.\nInclude a system that operates using Windows 10.\nHave total dimensions (WxDxH) not to exceed 42 inches x 23 inches x 23 inches due to existing lab space limitations.\nUse 110-120V outlet due to existing lab set up and compatibility. Any other outlet type would require a new outlet and take several weeks for installation. \nOPTIONAL TRADE-IN:\nQuoters are encouraged to provide a trade-in credit for a Government-Owned Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (S/N E97501007) and its adjoining Apple Mac Pro (Model A1186, S/N G8816357XYL) that have been identified to be in “fair” condition by the NCI Property Management Branch. Quoters offering a trade-in credit shall provide all applicable costs for removal of the existing system such as labor, equipment, packaging/crates, shipping, and insurance.\n4.1 DELIVERY / INSTALLATION\nDelivery shall be within 90 business days of purchase order award.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.\n\n(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) “Principal,” for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.\n\n(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror’s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.\n\nContractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor\'s name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

Currently NIA does not have a microscope attached to camera that we can use to take pictures of H&E stained slides under brightfield for publication purposes. The NIA Sections perform H&E staining on a weekly if not daily basis but do not have a tool to record it with the same regularity. Furthermore, we are requesting that this microscope be equipped with the ability to photograph fluorescence slides – to be able to take basic pictures of islets and brain stained for basic green, blue and red fluorescence. We need this to quantify insulin and glucagon positive areas in pancreatin taken from our different mouse models.  The microscope has the capability to take high  quality pictures more productively and is versatile enough to meet our needs.  The combination of optics for both high resolution brightfield and fluorescence  and the ability to integrate the Zeiss Zen software into our downstream meta data analysis mean this specific system is required for NIA’s research purposes.\nThe intent of this action is to purchase an inverted microscope.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

These instruments are the only apparatus currently available to test short access taste preference in mice. The Davis Rig instruments that we are currently using are over 10 years old and have been causing problems in our recent experiments.  Specifically, connections between the rig and the computer are worn and damaged, leading to difficulties in acquiring data. The new system comes complete with a computer for each rig. Three rigs are required in total so that we can collect data from several mice of the same transgenic model at the same age in a timely fashion.  The Davis Rig models that are currently used for short access taste testing in our projects are over 10 years old and have been causing problems in our recent assessment of the taste perception of our insulin knock -out mice. These are the only apparatus currently available to test short access taste preference in mice.  Connections between the rig and the computer are worn and damaged leading to difficulties in acquiring data. The new system comes complete with a computer for each rig. Three rigs are required in total in order to obtain data in a timely fashion on our models so that we can collect data from several mice of the same model at the same age. There have been significant upgrades to the system we are requesting that we require to ensure that the results we are getting are accurate. Specifically, the model that we have currently uses a motorized shutter which can trap the snout of the mouse and thus hurt the mouse. This we understand has adversely affected our data acquisition by introducing a variable we cannot control for i.e. the adverse reaction of the mouse to being hurt by the shutter and thus not wanting to return to lick yet again. The desire for a particular taste in the short access study is quantified by the number of licks that the mouse gives to the bottle with that particular taste and the motorized shutter is adversely affecting their responses. The new system comes with a gravity controlled shutter that does not trap the mouse’s snout and thus does not confound the data with this effect.\nThe intent of this action is to purchase a Lick Access Instrument.   The Lick Access Instrument should be brand-name or equal to the Davis Rig Brief Access Lickometer , manufactures by Med Associates, Inc., P.O. Box 319, St. Albans, VT 05478, Part MED-DAV-160M for Mouse, 16 Bottle, Legacy Version; and COM-106-NV, Intel i5-7400 3.5GHz, 16GB RAM, 1TB HDD, Windows 10 Pro 64bit equipment. \nSalient characteristics.  Brief access lickometery studies assess taste preference, chemotransduction pathways, and ingestive behavior in a rapid, efficient manner.  Functional improvements from DiLog Instruments’ design: (1) “Normally up” shutter mechanism (gravity instead of motor driven); and (2) Longer sipper tube to fit new plate design. \nPrior to the 16 bottle setup, the most common taste response setup was the two bottle preference test, where two bottles of fluid are placed in an animal’s cage with one of taste solution (or water) and the other a different taste solution. This test is simple, doesn’t require much in the way of additional equipment, and is relatively straightforward to administer. However, such simplicity comes at the price of interpretive ability. Although taste plays a sizable role in influencing the amount and type of foods/fluids ingested (as in a 2-bottle test), other factors (such as post-ingestive events) can influence behavior.\nThe brief access lickometer is designed to deliver taste samples and measure responses, increasing likelihood that the behavior of the animal is under orosensory control. It can also be used to assess taste preference, ingestive behavior, and chemotransduction pathways in a rapid, efficient manner as there is no dead space in stimulus delivery lines to make fluid volumes consistent across trials, as well as lick tracking without passing electrical current through the animal. It also enables measurement of both unconditioned and conditioned licking behavior to stimuli and/or can be used to train the animal with various stimuli to obtain a reward and/or avoid punishment.\nThe Davis Rig packages contain everything needed for running brief access lickometery studies in a single subject. The eponymous Davis Rig is the only apparatus on the market to test for short access taste preferences in mice.\n(vii) Government's Anticipated Delivery: Within Six (6) to Eight (8) Weeks After Receipt of Order (ARO).

The system must be able to work without computer control or software. The Sexton Corporation system has a uniquely capable product that meets all the project\nrequirements and specifications. Project requirements include the following camera specifications: 3840 x 2160 resolution at 30 frames per second; color imagers; synchronization between cameras; 70 degrees field of view; uncompressed video recording and live preview; and automated zoom, iris and focus. This specific camera has a patented technique called “super resolution zoom” that is required for maximum clarity of recordings. The camera also has specific settings to help with underwater visibility. The housing must be capable of continual submersion at 40 feet. The camera system must provide complete coverage of the water column in the center of the--------------. The volume of the water column coverage is approximately 150’ by 230’ by 40’. The output of the camera and recording system must be HDMI format. The Sexton Corporation system is the most cost effective solution as it is a complete turn-key system and includes the underwater housing, the cameras, the recorders, the video mixer and the cabling. No other vendor was identified that could supply the entire turn-key system. Due to upcoming testing at the ---------------, it is most efficient in terms of both cost and time to purchase a\nturn-key system that is plug-n-play versus developing a system in-house through multiple vendors without the assurance the individual components will work together as a system. The Sexton Corporation is the only source that provides the turn-key system meeting the requirements.\nA determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with FAR 13.106-1(b).\n  The Contracting Officer has determined that the order represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government’s needs.\nA description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted.\n  For the reasons specified in paragraph 4 above, The Sexton Corporation is the only source that can meet the Government’s needs.

Do not process unclassified DoD information on publically available computers (e.g. those available for use by the general public in kiosks or hotel business centers)\n         b.  Protect unclassified DoD information by at least one physical or electronic barrier (e.g. locked container or room logical authentication or logon procedure) when not under direct individual control of an authorized user.\n         c.  At a minimum overwrite media that have been used to process unclassified DoD information before external release or disposal.\n         d.  Encrypt all information that has been identified as CUI when it is stored on mobile computing devices such as laptops and personal digital assistants compact disks or authorized removable storage media such as thumb drives and compact disks using the best encryption technology available to the contractor or teaming partner.\n         e.  Limit transfer of unclassified DoD information to subcontractors or teaming partners with a need to know and obtain a commitment from them to protect the information they receive to at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.\n         f.  Transmit e-mail text messages and similar communications containing unclassified DoD information using technology and processes that provide the best level of privacy available given facilities conditions and environment. Examples of recommended technologies or processes include closed networks virtual private networks public key-enabled encryption and transport layer security (TLS)\n         g.  Encrypt organizational wireless connections and use encrypted wireless connections where available when traveling. If encrypted wireless is not available encrypt document files (e.g. spreadsheet and word processing files) using at least application-provided password protected level encryption.\n         h.  Transmit voice and fax transmissions only when there is a reasonable assurance that access is limited to authorized recipients.\n         i. Do not post unclassified DoD information to website pages that are publicly available or have access limited only by domain or Internet protocol restriction. Such information may be posted to website pages that control access by user identification and password user certificates or other technical means and provide protection via use of TLS or other equivalent technologies during transmission. Access control may be provided by the intranet (vice the website itself or the application it hosts)\n         j.  Provide protection against computer network intrusions and data exfiltration minimally including:\n     (1) Current and regularly updated malware protection services e.g. anti-virus anti-spyware.\n     (2) Monitoring and control of both inbound and outbound network traffic (e.g. at the external boundary sub-networks individual hosts) including blocking unauthorized ingress egress and exfiltration through technologies such as firewalls and router policies intrusion prevention or detection services and host-based security services.\n           (3) Prompt application of security-relevant software patches service packs and hot fixes.\n         k.  Comply with other current Federal and DoD information protection and reporting requirements for specified categories of information (e.g. medical proprietary critical program information (CPI) personally identifiable information export controlled) as specified in contracts grants and other legal agreements.\n         l.  Report loss or unauthorized disclosure of unclassified DoD information in accordance with contract grant or other legal agreement requirements and mechanisms.\n         m. Do not use external IT services (e.g. e-mail content hosting database document processing) unless they provide at least the same level of protection as that specified in the contract or other written agreement.\nOperations Security\nOperations Security (OPSEC) is concerned with the protection of critical information:  facts about intentions capabilities operations or activities that are needed by adversaries or competitors to bring about failure or unacceptable consequences of mission accomplishment.\nCritical information includes information regarding:\n   - Operations missions and exercises test schedules or locations;\n   - Location/movement of sensitive information equipment or facilities;\n   - Force structure and readiness (e.g. recall rosters);\n   - Capabilities vulnerabilities limitations security weaknesses;\n   - Intrusions/attacks of DoD networks or information systems;\n   - Network (and system) user IDs and passwords;\n   - Movements of key personnel or visitors (itineraries agendas etc.); and\n   - Security classification of equipment systems operations etc.\nThe contractor subcontractors and their personnel shall employ the following countermeasures to mitigate the susceptibility of critical information to exploitation when applicable:\n   - Practice OPSEC and facilitate OPSEC awareness;\n   - Immediately retrieve documents from printers assessable by the public;\n   - Shred sensitive and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) documents when no longer needed;\n   - Protect information from personnel without a need-to-know;\n   - When promulgating information limit details to that essential for legitimacy;\n   - During testing and evaluation practice OPSEC methodologies of staging out of sight desensitization or speed of execution whenever possible.\nSection F - Deliveries or performance\n  F.O.B.\n52.247-34 FOB Origin\nSection G  \n252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (Dec 2018)\n252.232-7006 Wide Area Workflow Payment Instructions\n  Section I – Contract Clauses\n  52.204-25 Prohibition on Contracting for Certain Telecommunications and Video Surveillance Services or Equipment.\n52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (Oct 2018)\n52.204-19 Incorporation by Reference of Representations and Certifications (Dec 2014)\n52.209-6 Protecting the Government’s Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (Oct 2015)\n52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items (May 2015)\n52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (Mar 2020)\nPreselected:\n52.203-19 Prohibition on Requiring Certain Internal Confidentiality Agreements or Statement (Jan 2017)\n52.209-10 Prohibition on Contracting with Inverted Domestic Corporations (Nov 2015)\n52.233-3 Protest After Award (Aug 1996)\n52.233-4 Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (Oct 2004)\n  Required:\n52.222-50 Combatting Trafficking in Persons (Mar 2015)\n52.223-18 Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (Aug 2011) \n52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--System for Award Management JUL 2013\n52.232-39 Unenforceability of Unauthorized Obligations (Jun 2013)\n52.232-40 Providing Accelerated Payments to Small Business Subcontractors (Dec 2013) \n52.243-1 Changes Fixed-Price\n52.246-4 Inspection of Services\n252.203-7000 Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials (SEP 2011)\n252.203-7002 Requirement to Inform Employees of Whistleblower Rights (Sep 2013) \n252.204-7003 Control of Government Work Product (Apr 1992) \n252.204-7009 Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third-Party Contractor Reported Cyber Incident Information\n252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting (Oct 2016)\n252.204-7015 Notice of Authorized Disclosure of Information by Litigation Support (May 2016)\n252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)\n252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)\n252.247-7023 Transportation of Supplies by Sea (Apr 2014)\n252.246-7007 Contractor Counterfeit Electronic Part Detection and Avoidance System\n252.246-7008 Sources of Electronic Parts\n252.215-7013 Supplies and Services Provided by Nontraditional Defense Contractors.

The systems will need to be installed in two separate facilities – a warehouse space and a smaller lab location.\nPSCR is researching the use of virtual and augmented reality for developing, testing, and training on future user interfaces. The lab has developed a variety of virtual environments and scenarios that mimic high risk first responder events using the Unreal Engine. This testbed can be leveraged by developers and researchers for evaluating new technologies for fire fighters, emergency medical services, and law enforcement. A large physical space with tracking will allow for greater immersion of the users by mirroring physical interactions and cognitive load.\nSCOPE\nThe Contractor shall design, deliver, and install a high speed optical camera tracking system for use in a large warehouse environment and a small lab space. The warehouse environment will support a 35’ x 40’ demo area and require tracking around perimeter and cross the center in a grid layout. The lab space will be a smaller scale deployment used for research and development.\nThis system’s software and networking will run on a Dell server and Juniper/Cisco hardware to be provided by PSCR. The Contractor must use the OptiTrack hardware and software as it is the only system identified that supports the Unreal Engine. The Contractor shall install all software and hardware at the FirstNet Authority and PSCR laboratories in Boulder, Colorado.\nThe Contractor must provide additional equipment to support the space including virtual and augmented reality headsets, backpack VR computers, rubber floors for play space, and modular walls for configuring various layouts.\n2.

Point of Contact Lawrence Thomas, Contract Specialist, e-mail address: lawrence.thomas1@va.gov STATEMENT OF WORK General: This statement of work defines the effort required for VA North Texas Healthcare System (VANTHCS), Interventional Cardiology Section of Medicine Service to procure an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) with Pulsed Volume Recording (PVR) system that is a noninvasive vascular test involving a vascular doppler and blood pressure cuffs used to obtain information about arterial blood flow in the upper and lower extremities. This procurement covers essential equipment required to develop a vascular medicine program. The vascular medicine program will be aligned under the Interventional Cardiology service line and will serve as an early intervention/screening program preceding the need for Vascular Surgery intervention. The program will be managed by the Clinical Nurse Manager, Cardiology under the direction of the Section Chief, Cardiology. The intended place of performance includes multiple sites within the VANTHCS including the Dallas, Bonham, Plano, and Fort Worth campuses. This acquisition will require a single occurrence delivery schedule of equipment with a fixed-rate purchase agreement. The equipment will be delivered to the VANTHCS warehouse, assigned an equipment inventory number through the logistics department, and undergo an electrical-biomedical safety inspection by the Bio-med service at VANTHCS-Dallas campus prior to delivery to the service. The service will inspect the purchase/inventory statement against delivered items and accept the equipment for use upon receipt. Description of Work: The ABI/PVR system will be used to assess the peripheral vascular status in patients screened as "high risk" seen in the Vascular Medicine program. The primary purpose of the ABI/PVR is to identify the anatomy and malfunctioning vessels (arteries and veins) and assess the extent of insufficiency present. ABI is the cornerstone of PAD/PVD evaluation. The equipment involves the use of four blood pressure cuffs place strategically on each upper and lower extremity (see fig 1 below). A measurement is recorded from each cuff. The measurements are compared against standard parameters to diagnose the presence of PVD/PAD and determine significance. A dual ABI/PVR system provides a complete, thorough workup and eliminates the inherent limitations of stand-alone ABI. On-site Equipment and training: Contractor will provide on-site training regarding standard operating procedures of the System. Training will include a demonstration of how to use all the listed features of the System as well as any applicable User configuration including installation support. Requested delivery date is 30 days from award. Manufacturer: Unetixs Model: Roodra, Unetixs Multilab Series III Location: 5B668, Dallas VA Medical Center at 4500 S. Lancaster Rd.

Principles of operation: Multi-lab system to perform upper and lower arterial pressures and waveforms. f. Restrictive environmental conditions: Touchscreen, ergonomic design, height adjustable, battery system, mobile g. Intended use: The system would be utilized in multi-specialties for veterans in Cardiology and Vascular Surgery on and inpatient and outpatient basis. It would be used as a non-invasive test to determine if patients are getting adequate blood flow to their extremities at rest and after stress. h. Equipment with which the item is used with (N/A if not applicable): N/A i. End item application: The system is used to determine if the patient s blood supply to the upper and lower limbs can be improved with an intervention by opening blocked arteries. j. Original equipment manufacturer part number: MULTILAB SERIES III ROODRA VASCULAR SYSTEM with DICOM SR k. Other pertinent information that describes the item, material or service required: The equipment must provide Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), pulse volume recording, doppler waveforms, and toe pressures. The Interventional Cardiology Section requires an ABI/PVR system to perform early assessment/identification of patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and/or peripheral vascular disease (PVD). PAD/PVD affects more than eight million Americans. Despite significant associated morbidity and mortality less than 3% of the screening recommended population undergo early assessment or intervention. The Society for Vascular Medicine recommends screening for the following patients at risk for PAD/PVD: By Specific Age At Any Age <50 years old with Diabetes or other atherosclerotic risk factor Exertional leg symptoms or resting ischemic pain 50-69 years old with history of smoking or diabetes Abnormal pulse in the lower extremity >70 years old with or without risk factors Atherosclerotic disease: coronary, carotid or renal Adaptedfrom Hirsch AT et al. Available at www.acc.org/clinical/guidelines/pad/summary.pdf 45.2% of the veteran population served at VANTHCS are between the ages of 4564 with a mean age of 58 years old, more than 28% of the veterans served at VANTHCS have diabetes, and 62% of the total veterans enrolled for care at the Dallas VA Medial Center. VANTHCS report smoking or prior tobacco abuse. Approximately 45% or greater of the total veterans served at VANTHCS fall into one or more of the recommended PAD/PVD screening groups. We currently cannot provide this needed clinical service secondary to lack of an existing Vascular Medicine program and lack of required equipment. It is intended to develop, structure, and implement a comprehensive Vascular Medicine program using standardized clinical screening and intervention guidelines to address the disparities that currently exists. Place of Performance: Dallas VA Medical Center at 4500 S. Lancaster Rd. Dallas TX 75216 Information technology security & Privacy requirements: The contractor, their personnel, and their subcontractors shall be subject to the Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks regarding information and information system security as delineated in this contract. The contractor shall comply with all Federal laws and regulations the VA has developed when VA sensitive information is accessed, used, stored, generated, transmitted, or exchanged by and between VA and a contractor; specifically, the contractor will be required to complete VA Privacy and Information Security training, or a privacy training that is equivalent. Privacy training certificates showing completion of the training should be provided by the Contractor upon request by VA. The information made available to the contractor by VA for the performance of this contract will be used only for the purposes of performance under this contract. The certification and accreditation requirements do not apply to this requirement and a security accreditation package is not required. As prescribed in 839.201, insert the following clause: The contractor, their personnel, and their subcontractors shall be subject to the Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks regarding information and information system security as delineated in this contract. 1. GENERAL Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS Information Technology Security & Privacy Requirements.Â  a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor\'s rights to use data as described in Rights in Data- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above-mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

A flow cytometer is an essential piece of equipment for the pre-clinical group in the MIP and is used to analyze optical probes and cell receptors.\n3.0 TYPE OF ORDER\nThis is a Firm-Fixed-Price Purchase Order.\n4.0 PRODUCT FEATURES/SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS\nThe instrument shall:\nInclude a monitor for end users to view several gating results at a time and a separate desktop computer for end users to set up studies, analyze data and copy to flash drive if needed. \nInclude polystyrene beads dyed with fluorochromes that allows the software to characterize, track, and report performance measurements for the flow cytometer. Beads shall consist of equal quantities of bright, mid, and dim beads in phosphate buffered saline with sodium azide.\nPerform automated single tube QC (quality control) with dyed polystyrene beads instead of requiring manual QC using single color beads.\nInclude bead dilution buffer, cleaning agent for daily use, and fluid for running the instrument\nInclude at no charge fluorescent beads containing the following dyes:  FITC, PE, APC, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC-Cy7, PerCP, and dyes with absorptions of 415nm and 404nm and emission peaks of 500nm and 448nm, respectively. The beads need only to be run every 60 days and enable the software to determine spillover values (SOVs) for fluorescence compensation and calculate a fluorescence compensation matrix during setup of flow cytometer.\nHave a minimum of 3 lasers (red, blue and violet) and be capable of detecting a minimum of 8 dyes. The 8 dyes shall include followings; FITC, PE, PCP-Cy5.5 and PE-Cy7 from blue laser, APC or Alexa Fluor 647, APC-Cy7 from red laser, and dyes capable of being detected with a violet laser with maximum absorptions between 404-407nm and 405-415nm and emission peaks between 421-448nm and 500-510nm, respectively. \nHave the ability to be upgraded on-site by the manufacturer to detect an additional 4 dyes for a total of 12 dyes. The additional dyes shall include Alexa Fluor 700, and dyes optimized and excited by a violet laser with the following absorption and emission wavelengths: 405nm, 407nm, 407nm and 600-602nm, 702-711nm, 780-786nm, respectively.  This increases the instrument’s flexibility.\nOffer a manual sample acquisition capable of accepting 12 x 75-mm tubes and microcentrifuge tubes. Manual acquisition is useful if you only have a few samples or samples that aren’t in 96 well plates.\nProvide software with the ability to automate the process of compensating the spectral overlap of fluorochromes used in the lab. The software shall allow the user to export the user-defined assays in given format so that users can reproduce assays at different times.\nCapable of collecting events (data from cells) at very high speed (minimum of 25,000 events per second). This allows several events to be collected rapidly and a sufficient number of cells for statistically significant detection.\nBe capable of acquiring unlimited events per sample so the users can collect data from rare cell populations effectively.\nInclude a system that offers superior sensitivity to detect low intensity signal effectively such as gel coupled flow cell or equivalent.\nBe capable of a High Sensitivity Mode (flow rate 50uL/min) in order to accommodate samples that contain rare populations. This mode allows the cells to travel through the laser beam at half the usual sheath velocity and allows for a two-fold increase in sensitivity.\nUse the heptagon fluorescence collection system or equivalent which minimizes the number of times fluorescence signals shall pass through dichroic mirrors, maximizing signal intensity and eliminating alignment of fluorescence channels.\nInclude electronic IDs (chip coded) or equivalent for each filter-mirror combination, ensuring that the configuration is as expected for a given experiment. In case of mismatch the user can identify that before collecting data, ensuring accurate results.            \nBe capable of setting multiple parameter threshold.  The ability to threshold on more than one parameter is a very powerful tool when working with small particles or sample preps with large amounts of unwanted particles.\nInclude a universal sample loader capable of using 12x75mm tube racks as well as a 96 well plate. The ability to set up multiple 12x75mm sample tubes or a 96 well plate and walk away saves the user time from standing at the instrument.  The end user requires the ability to set up multiple 12x75mm tubes in order to collect rare cells from tumor samples from large volumes. Per the lab’s sample preparation protocol, samples are strained through a filter attached to 12x75mm tubes. The same tube is used in the instrument to save time and money. To maintain consistency and prevent loss of sample, a loader capable of using a 12x75mm tube rack is required. One sample loader capable of accommodating both types of sample sizes saves space and time of switching out loader each time running samples.\nInclude automated on board vortexing of tubes and plates for mixing and resuspension of cells. The automated vortexing prevents the cells from settling at the bottom of the tube.  Strength and duration of vortexing can be determined by the end user in the software program.\nInclude 30 and 40 tube (12x75mm) racks for sample loader. The racks are required to run the samples in 12x75mm tubes for the sample loader and will allow the user to walk away and perform other studies. When analyzing primary tissue samples, the lab’s sample preparation protocol requires the use of a filter (strainer) that is attached to a 12x75mm tube.  The same tube is used to analyze the sample in the instrument which saves time and money. \nContain a loader that is equipped with barcode scanner that can match rack barcode and tube barcodes to what is expected per the software program and provide error management capabilities in case of mismatch. This allows the user to walk away after the start of the multi-tube or plate run.\nBe capable of programming an automated start up and auto shutdown and power off to increase productivity.\nInclude a system that operates using Windows 10.\nHave total dimensions (WxDxH) not to exceed 42 inches x 23 inches x 23 inches due to existing lab space limitations.\nUse 110-120V outlet due to existing lab set up and compatibility. Any other outlet type would require a new outlet and take several weeks for installation. \nOPTIONAL TRADE-IN:\nQuoters are encouraged to provide a trade-in credit for a Government-Owned Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer (S/N E97501007) and its adjoining Apple Mac Pro (Model A1186, S/N G8816357XYL) that have been identified to be in “fair” condition by the NCI Property Management Branch.

A major source for the synchrotron X-rays in the US will be unavailable in the near future due to a major multi-year upgrade at The Advanced Photon Source.  These upgrades mean that  there is going be a significantly increased need for X-rays at the NIH for crystallographic data collection. This need can be met by taking full advantage of recent developments in laboratory based X-ray source technology and X-ray detector technology.\nThe project is aimed at providing the best possible quality Macromolecular X-ray Crsytallography (MX) data collection capabilities to support the mission of the NIDDK to understand how critical biological acromolecules work through the elucidation of their molecular structure. The need is clear as there will be several years when MX capabilities in the US will be significantly decreased due the upgrade process of the Advanced Photon Source where NIDDK researchers currently collect MX data. The\ncombination of an FR-X high flux X-ray generator, the VariMax VHF confocal X-ray optics and the EigerR 4M hybrid photon counting (HPC) detector manufactured by Rigaku Americas together will create an MX platform approaching the capabilities of a synchrotron bending magnet beamline. The combination of these instruments provides the best possible laboratory based MX capabilities available as it allows development.\n3.0    OBJECTIVE\nThe main objective of this acquisition is to provide the NIDDK and NIH structural biology groups with an X-ray crystallographic resource that can provide better diffraction data quality than the existing resources, and can approach the data quality that can be measured at synchrotron bending magnet beamline.  In addition, this purchase will provide the NIDDK X-ray diffraction laboratory with two Eiger 4M hybrid photon counting detectors on the two available ports of a new high flux density rotating anode generator.  Furthermore, the laboratory will also have a BioSAX-1000 small angle scattering system re-installed on an existing MicroMax-007 HF X-ray generators.\nPlease note that the NIDDK wishes to trade in the following equipment to Rigaku Americas Corporation which will no longer fit the NIDDK’s needs:\n•    MicroMax-007HF (SN: DD307408), will be reclaimed by Rigaku for trade-in (includes packing and removal)\n•    Saturn A200 (SN: 09380200), will be reclaimed by Rigaku for trade-in (includes packing and removal)\n4.0     SALIENT / REQUIRED FEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS\nTotal system price includes both delivery and inside delivery, assembly, installation, 12 months on-site labor and parts warranty (excluding consumables), and on-site basic operation/maintenance training. \n•    Contractor will ship and install a rotating anode X-ray generator that is dual port and generates X-ray radiation using a Cu target.\n•    The source of the X-ray source on the surface of the target will not be larger than 70 microns approximately in effective size taking the option take off angle into consideration.\n•    The maximum loading on this source has to be at least 2.97 kW.\n•    The contractor will ship and install a confocal optical system that will focus X-rays from the X-ray source to a 100 micron pinhole of the collimator that will be supplied by the contractor.

(b) Certification. By submitting this offer, the offeror certifies that it is not: (1) Taking or knowingly agreeing to take any action, with respect to the boycott of Israel by Arab League countries, which Section 8(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)) prohibits a United States person from taking; or, (2) Discriminating in the award of subcontracts on the basis of religion. (End of provision)\n\nSECTION 8(A) OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT OF 1979, AS AMENDED (AUG 1999) (a) Section 8(a) of the U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. 2407(a)), prohibits compliance by U.S. persons with any boycott fostered by a foreign country against a country which is friendly to the United States and which is not itself the object of any form of boycott pursuant to United States law or regulation.
